In the demo I am showing that basic sync capability of this application.

The two upper panels are syncing their content via the internet (it is just convenient to record a demo with them both on the same machine). The lower panel contains a local folder of images.

The last thing shown in the demo is the ability to sync a file from one client to another, even when the clients are not online at the same time.

Only 'create' and 'delete' file operations are supported. To rename a file or modify its contents, move it out from the synced directory, perform the change, and move it back to the synced directory.

You cannot perform operations on multiple files at the same time.

Only syncing of top-level files is supported, no directories.
